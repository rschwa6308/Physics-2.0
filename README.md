Physics-2.0 is a 2D n-body gravity simulator made in Python with the Pygame module. Bodies follow Newton's law of universal gravitation and conservation of momentum. This application can be used to demonstrate simple systems like binary stars, and complex systems like planetary accretion and stellar dynamics. It can also be used to model fluids. Phenomena such as the Ideal Gas Law and Brownian Motion can be observed in these scenarios. Physics-2.0 can be used in the classroom to help students develop an intuitive understanding of a wide range of topics in physics.
